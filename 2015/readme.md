# SFPC Administration and Finance report 2015 

In 2014 we held two sessions, a short two week program in the Spring and a ten week program in the fall. Both sessions were hosted at Orbital in 155 Rivington street. During the Fall 2014 we formed the ‘SFPC Steering Committee’ with SFPC founding partners, teachers and alumni who advise the session ‘Organizers’ running the program on daily basis. The SFPC Steering Committee includes Amit Pitaru, Allison Burtch, Ida C. Benedetto, Lauren Gardner, Taeyoon Choi, Tega Brain and Zach Lieberman. The Organizers take rotating responsibilities, often inviting alumni and teachers to be part of the team.  

*This report is written by Taeyoon Choi with Lauren Gardner in Spring 2016. We tried to contact everyone mentioned in the report prior to the publishing. However, in case we have missed someone or if there’s an error, feel free to contact them.*

# Spring 2015 session 

The Spring session was announced on January 2015 and was held between March 16 ~ May 22 at 155 Rivington st. in the Orbital. Lead organizers include Allison Burtch, Taeyoon Choi and Zach Lieberman.  

Allison, Casey, Taeyoon worked between sessions crafting and promoting the call for the students and admissions. Students were selected by Allison, Zach and Taeyoon with valuable input by the steering committee. 
 
There were a total of 18 students in the Spring semester from the U.S, Spain, South Korea, China, Mexico, Denmark, Ukraine, Turkey, Greece, Japan and other countries. Students were selected based on artistic merit and answers from their applications. We conducted video and real-life interviews for a few, but not all students to get a better sense of their level of interest and what they hoped to gain from the experience participating in the school. 

Nine students paid a full tuition of $5000 each and another nine students whose tuitions were subsidised by scholarships paid varying amounts. The scholarship students were chosen based on financial needs and SFPC’s mission for diversity in gender, race and accessibility. SFPC managed to provide these scholarships because some of the teachers took cuts in their payment. 

The breakdown in scholarships were:
One student who was offered a full scholarship.
Two students paying ⅕ tuition.
Four students paying ½ tuition. 
Two students paying ⅘ tuition. 

We had hoped the students would be self-directed and find out on their own how they could best contribute back to the school. However it would have served us better to have specific roles and responsibilities attached to the scholarship / work-study program. After the program. we got some feedback from the students that it wasn’t transparent how we decided who would get the scholarship and what their responsibilities were upon accepting. This caused a slight sense of concern and discomfort among some students. We thank them for their honest feedback. Learning from their contribution, we were able to manage the work-study program more efficiently in the Fall program.  


## Salary 
The organizers, Allison, Zach and Taeyoon were responsible for the main administrative duties during the ten weeks session. In addition to teaching a class, they held office hours for the students and communicated with each other about the needs of the space and public events. Their salary was calculated as $5000 for teaching 10 weeks of class plus $5000 for administrative work, totalling $10000 for each. Zach took a partial cut in his payment to accompany more work-study students, also some admin duties were passed on to other organizers. 

Casey Gollan, who acted as an administrator was responsible for finance and communicating with legal experts, as well as website management, contributed immensely to the school. Casey left his post as the administrator at the end of May to focus on his own projects. We thank Casey for his work at SFPC, he made a lasting mark on our policy to focus on providing unique educational opportunity through transparent administration and finance. Casey was paid $7500 for his work in Spring 2015. 

After Casey left, Taeyoon picked up more administrative responsibilities. Starting with Summer 2015 session, Lauren Gardner and Taeyoon share administrative and financial work.  

Teachers, who lead short classes (less than 3 sessions) were paid $1500 each. 
Spring 2015 teachers include Allison Parrish, Ingrid Burrington, Surya Mattu and Jonathan Dahan. Teachers also include Lauren Gardner who was in charge of curating the final exhibition at the Babycastles Gallery. Notably, Jonathan Dahan donated his payment back to sfpc. 

Interview with the teachers about the academics on the [Creative Applications](http://www.creativeapplications.net/education/teaching-and-learning-at-sfpc-conversation-with-allison-parrish-and-surya-mattu/ ).

We had visiting speakers and critics including. Rosa Menkman, Sara Hendren, Gene Kogan, Caitlin Morris, Michael Allison, Heather Dewey-Hagborg, Kyle McDonald, Lindsay Howard, Jay Zehngebot. We thank them for their generosity and excitement, to help support their ongoing research and creative practices we paid each visitor 150$. Daito Manabe and Mushon Zer-Aviv generously donated their speaker fee back to SFPC, we thank them. 

## Expenses

Some of the expenses for the Spring semester include incidentals necessary for the the final exhibition however the rental of the space was donated by Babycastles Gallery. We thank them. 

Documentation and photography for the final showcase by Emi Spicer: $250 

Legal + Finance by a CPA:  $1500 

Rent for the 10 weeks of the Spring session and storage during the interim was paid to Orbital for $15,450. We’d especially like to recognize that Orbital extended full access to the entire building and their facilities at cost which is a huge gift to the school and it’s students. We’d like to thank Gary Chou and the entire Orbital community for being a generous host and friend to the school. Orbital’s involvement in the school extends beyond merely providing a ‘space’. Students are incorporated directly into the community of artists and entrepreneurs gathered at Orbital, building friendships and even collaborations. The shared values between organizations has helped build a network of support and collaboration enabling SFPC students and Orbital residents to continue their personal and professional pursuits together. 

# Cash flow problem

There was a short-term cash flow problem in June and July. Timely deposits for the summer programs weren’t made corresponding with various vendors cashing their rent check for the Spring session. 

![image]()

When the balance was below zero in the SFPC account. Taeyoon made a one-time deposit of $2000 from personal account to keep the balance positive. It was made in two payments between June 29th with $1200 and July 7th with $800. On July 27, when the balance was stable with the summer deposits, Taeyoon transferred $2000 back to the personal account.   

This was a devastating learning experience. We learned that we can’t operate on ‘term to term’ basis because of the ongoing expenses and unexpected delay in payment and expenses.  

# Summer 2015

The summer program was announced in May and was held in between July 27th ~ August 9th at 137 W 14th St. in Babycastles Gallery. http://sfpc.io/summer2015/  Lead organizers include Todd Anderson, Taeyoon Choi, Lauren Gardner.


## Summer budget and expenses 


We accepted 10 students on a rolling basis, most of them were working in New York. All of the classes were held in evenings, making it possible for them to continue to work and take classes.  We had few students from Boston and Portland who came to New York to participate in the program. 

Tuition was $1500 per student. We had 10 students and a few donations from single session class attendance through ticket sales. Total income through tuition was $15,450. 
One student, Katie Rose Pipkin’s tuition was made possible by The Studio for Creative Inquiry and CMU School of Fine Art.  

## Salary 
Administrators were paid an hourly rate for their participation. The admins were expected to organize the call for participation, student selection, teachers and workshops, class schedule, notes and documentation, general space organization and be on hand and accountable for any student questions and issues that may arise. Both Lauren Gardner and Todd Anderson were administrators for the summer session, Lauren was paid $2275 and Todd was paid $2800 in total with an additional fee for his role in teaching a class.Taeyoon was involved with organizing the session as well but donated his payment back to the school. 

Teachers were paid $1000 for their participation in the summer session teaching two-day classes. The teachers were Allison Parrish, Nick Montfort, Sara Groff Palermo and Todd Anderson. There was also a half-day workshop led by Ranjit Bhatnagar where we payed him $250 for his generous amount of time he shared with the students.
Savings and Expenses

The summer session was a successful experimentation in running a part time program, which we hope to be able to do more in the future. The Spring 2014 was also a two week program with a fantastic group of students and teachers, however it was not profitable or sustainable for the school. In the Summer 2015, taking the learnings from the previous experiment, we were determined to make it a financially viable/reasonable.

There was a little over $275 spent on various food related expenses during the summer session and we paid $2000 in rent to Babycatles gallery for the two week Summer term. Overall we were able to save $5000 for SFPC which we deposited in the school account. 


# Overview

Interim (between Summer & Fall ‘15 sessions)
Recurring expenses were incurred for things such as subscriptions to accounting software, insurance and bank fees. 

There was also a one time payment of $2,000 to Taeyoon for administration work done between sessions including but not limited to paying teachers/admins from summer, collecting payment from the students, updating the website, finding a new location to hold the Fall session and securing a lease, creating and promoting the call for attendees for the Fall session and organizing the student selection and responding to students. Additional admission work was donated by the steering committee and also external reviewers including Lauren McCarthy and SFPC alumni Katie Simillie and Andrew Kleindolph.  

Upon confirmation of a new lease at 155 Bank St. at the Westbeth Artist Housing Complex, $425 was spent with Sungshim moving company to move all of the school’s supplies (books, furniture, hardware and equipment) to our new location.

An additional $600 was spent on building new custom furniture for our new space to be used in the classroom and workrooms. The furniture was beautifully built by artist Nick Doyle.
Fall 2015 session 

The Fall application’s deadline for new students was June 21 and the Fall session was held between September 15th ~ November 27th. Lead organizers include Taeyoon Choi, Lauren Gardner and Zach Lieberman.

Students came from Germany, Houston, Boston, Austria, Chile, South Korea, Ireland and other places. 


## Tuition

The tuition costs for the Fall semester were increased from $5,000 to $5,500. For all accepted students, we asked for a $500 non-refundable deposit to be paid by August 10th, 2015 to reserve their place in the Fall session. Twelve students were accepted however one could not attend after paying the deposit. Of the additional eleven students who were able to attend, one was given a 50% work-study scholarship in exchange for weekly blog posts, website and social media account updates and other general duties around the space.  Total amount of income made from tuition was $58,500.

## Visitor’s Fees

Typically we host visitors and speakers throughout the semester however, this year we decided to frontload the majority of visitor talks during a ‘SFPC Salon’, an event held over two evenings of talks. Visitors were paid $100 for their participation although some of the visiting speakers chose not to be paid. 

Visitors who spoke at the SFPC Salon included Kaho Abe, Jason Levine, Jane Friedhoff, David Nolan, Ida Benedetto, Luisa Perira Hors, Benjamin Walter, Mariko Kosaka and Josh Michaels. We are grateful to Jay Silver and Zach Lieberman for donating their time to speak at the Salon in lieu of payment.

There were two visitors that were paid $100 to speak during the semester and one who was paid $150 for a talk that was of a longer duration. Those speakers were Caroline Sinders, Nick Montfort and Cory Arcangel.


## Salary
Due to change in the overall budget accepting a smaller amount of students, we scaled back payment to the organizers from 10K to 6K. The organizers for the Fall session were Zach Lieberman, Taeyoon Choi and Lauren Gardner. 

Teachers were paid $4,000 for their involvement during the year teaching a total of eight classes. The Fall teachers included Ramsey Nasser, Caitlin Morris and Allison Parrish. Additional classes and workshops were taught by Taeyoon and Zach at no additional expense to the school and we’d very much like to acknowledge their donation of time.

We also allocated $700 to introduced a new teaching assistant position to the Fall session and were happy that Gene Kogan was on hand to help students through any homework questions they had and also introduce the students to new tools and concepts. We are working on developing such position into a more structured category of “Artist In Residence” or “Teacher In Residence” in future sessions. 

## Expenses 
Thankfully due to the generosity of the Westbeth Corp. HDFC. INC, a non for profit org that manages our current space at 155 Bank st., our total rent expenditure was reduced in comparison to previous semesters. Our total rent for three months during the duration of the semester was $6,000. We paid an additional $2,000 for a December extension and are currently negotiating a lease renewal at $2,000/month.  

A rent-related expense was made to IRL for $425 for use of their space for the Fall session final party with family and friends and that fee also included a cleaning fee for use of their space for the Summer session’s similar final party event.

We paid a professional photographer $450 to photograph the final student exhibition. 

We paid a professional cleaner s a total of $500 to come in once a week and help deep clean the space. 

We paid Eyebeam a subsidized rate of $1000 for two days of classes held on site at their location. This also included time spent learning how to use their equipment like laser cutters and 3D printers. We thank them for cooperation. 

There were additional fabrication expenses accrued during the final showcase paid to NYC resistor for Laser cutting service at $160 and individually to David Huerta as a laser cutter operator for $75.

There were also additional reimbursements up to $1,040.20 made to Taeyoon and Lauren for expenses accrued during the semester primarily around food and school supplies.

# Day for Night 

Day for Night was a music and visual art festival held in Houston, TX. in which we participated during December 2015. Here is an article about the installation we made for the event: 

[Link](ttp://www.dayfornight.io/index.php/2015/10/07/school-for-poetic-computation/
)

A separate budget for this event was created to differentiate between event expenses and school expenses. Most expenses accrued after November 27th are included on this budget which can be found here:  [Inactive link]

We agreed to a participation fee of $10k in addition to reimbursement of up to $1,500 for travel and an $1,500 for housing. All our invoices were sent in early January (with receipts) and have been fully reimbursed for travel and accommodation. We have received partial payment for the participation fee (50% at $5,000) and will continue to follow up to resolve the outstanding balance.  

Most of the expenses in December for the festival include renting an AirBnB for housing, printing zines and stickers, rental car and gas, getting small electronic parts necessary for the installation and etc. 

Lauren, who was an administrator for the Fall session, acted as the event producer creating the budget and schedule for the installation, managing accommodations and travel while in Houston for the students and the communication between event staff and the school. She was compensated $2,000 for her role. We also paid three students $500 each for their role as leads on deliverables necessary for the success of the project like code, documentation and music/fx. We also will pay $1,000 to Zach for his work in organizing the contract and providing both artistic and architectural guidance on the installation. All of which is documented in detail within the event budget listed above.

# Lessons Learned in 2015

We learned in the Spring session that work-study scholarships should be more defined with roles, responsibilities and expected deadlines. We put this into practice during the Fall session asking for deliverables such as ‘create a blog to summarize the previous week and publish every Monday’. These clear expectations helped relieve administrators so they could focus on larger level tasks and also provided the students a sense of ownership and responsibility for communicating the school’s values further strengthening the bond between the school and themselves.

By the nature of how we work at the school it’s not easy to quantify the total amount of hours organizers and the steering committee put into working on school related tasks. We would like to find a way to better document the hours spent on planning, promoting, documenting and researching for the school. We acknowledge this invisible/ intangible labor that goes into making of a session, a class and exhibition is fundamentally important and is what makes SFPC unique. However, it is not a sustainable model and is done at the sacrifice of key contributors for the school. We are experimenting with opportunities to bring in more funds to the school through projects like Day for Night and hope such opportunities will provide reasonable salaries to compensate for the work everyone does.   
We increased our spending on the final student showcase to purchase things like materials, fabrication and professional photo documentation. This proved to be an invaluable resource for both the students and the school allowing us to showcase the student’s work in the ‘best possible light’ during the event and in perpetuity.

Decreasing the amount of visiting speaker talks during the semester in favor of frontloading a majority of them at the beginning of the session. This change made the semester much easier to organize and also provided a great way to kick-off the session introducing the students to a wealth of knowledge they would get to explore in more depth throughout the semester.

Although reducing the amount of students is harder on the budget it made for an easier semester and 10-12 feels like the ‘right’ size going forward. We had 18 students in the Spring and 12 in the Fall. The level of students engagement felt stronger in the Fall term with a smaller group. Smaller group meant we can spend more time and attention with individual students, and everyone was fully engaged until the very end of the term.
At the end of the year in 2014, SFPC.LLC had approximately $5000 in profit. Three partners, Amit, Taeyoon and Zach were responsible for  ⅓ of the taxable income. At the end of the year in 2015, SFPC.LLC had approximately $7500 in profit. The partners agreed to try changing division of profit/loss, Taeyoon was responsible for 99% of the taxable income and Zach for 1%. This doesn’t mean Taeyoon was paid in the profit, but rather he’s accountable for the tax of the company. This is part of an ongoing experiment to make SFPC.LLC sustainable for the partners involved.  

At the end of December 2014, we made last minute donations totalling $300 to other Non for profit organizations in New York City. We thought that would be processed in 2014 but they did not get processed until Jan 2nd 2015. We have been approached by corporations and institutions a few times about donations but nothing has been realized. We hope to find a way in which we can receive donations through fiscal sponsorship or other methods.
