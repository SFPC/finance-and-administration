Contemporary designers, besides giving objects form and function, write their initial scripts--the foundation for useful and satisfying conversations.

He needed a way to keep track of software development over time - whatever he was thinking about or working on. He researched subjects he found interesting, then documented his research with a public blog post, which he could easily find and refer to later. Over time, increasing numbers of blog visitors found the posts helpful, relevant and interesting. Now, approximately 100,000 readers visit the blog per day and nearly as many comment and interact on the site. Effective Programming: More Than Writing Code is your one-stop shop for all things programming. Jeff writes with humor and understanding, allowing for both seasoned programmers and newbies to appreciate the depth of his research. From such posts as ""The Programmer's Bill of Rights"" and ""Why Cant Programmers... Program?"" to ""Working With the Chaos Monkey,"" this book introduces the importance of writing responsible code, the logistics involved, and how people should view it more as a lifestyle than a career. TABLE OF CONTENTS - Introduction - The Art of Getting Shit Done - Principles of Good Programming - Hiring Programmers the Right Way - Getting Your Team to Work Together - The Batcave: Effective Workspaces for Programmers - Designing With the User in Mind - Security Basics: Protecting Your Users' Data - Testing Your Code, So it Doesn't Suck More Than it Has To - Building, Managing and Benefiting from a Community - Marketing Weasels and How Not to Be One - Keeping Your Priorities Straight EXCERPT FROM THE BOOK As a software developer, you are your own worst enemy. The sooner you realize that, the better off you'll be.I know you have the best of intentions. We all do. We're software developers; we love writing code. It's what we do. We never met a problem we couldn't solve with some duct tape, a jury-rigged coat hanger and a pinch of code. But Wil Shipley argues that we should rein in our natural tendencies to write lots of code: The fundamental nature of coding is that our task, as programmers, is to recognize that every decision we make is a trade-off. To be a master programmer is to understand the nature of these trade-offs, and be conscious of them in everything we write.In coding, you have many dimensions in which you can rate code: Brevity of codeFeaturefulnessSpeed of executionTime spent codingRobustnessFlexibility Now, remember, these dimensions are all in opposition to one another. You can spend three days writing a routine which is really beautiful and fast, so you've gotten two of your dimensions up, but you've spent three days, so the ""time spent coding"" dimension is way down.So, when is this worth it? How do we make these decisions? The answer turns out to be very sane, very simple, and also the one nobody, ever, listens to: Start with brevity. Increase the other dimensions as required by testing. I couldn't agree more. I've given similar advice when I exhorted developers to Code Smaller. And I'm not talking about a reductio ad absurdum contest where we use up all the clever tricks in our books to make the code fit into less physical space. I'm talking about practical, sensible strategies to reduce the volume of code an individual programmer has to read to understand how a program works. Here's a trivial little example of what I'm talking about: if (s == String.Empty)if (s == """") It seems obvious to me that the latter case is... ...buy the book to read more!",0,CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform,2014-05-22 17:24:24 +0000,,0,0,2012-07-04 04:00:00 +0000,$11.95,0,,,,,0,,,,Effective Programming: More Than Writing Code,,B17703EF-3E77-4C75-8A1F-7A253F75FBBA,,0,1.43,8.5,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41xDJ0SVCML.jpg

While teaching how to write programmable shaders, the authors also teach and reinforce the fundamentals of computer graphics. The second edition has been updated to incorporate changes in the OpenGL API (OpenGL 4.x and GLSL 4.x0) and also has a chapter on the new tessellation shaders, including many practical examples., , The book starts with a quick review of the graphics pipeline, emphasizing features that are rarely taught in introductory courses, but are immediately exposed in shader work. It then covers shader-specific theory for vertex, tessellation, geometry, and fragment shaders using the GLSL 4.x0 shading language. The text also introduces the freely available glman tool that enables you to develop, test, and tune shaders separately from the applications that will use them. The authors explore how shaders can be used to support a wide variety of applications and present examples of shaders in 3D geometry, scientific visualization, geometry morphing, algorithmic art, and more., , Features of the Second Edition:, , Written using the most recent specification releases (OpenGL 4.x and GLSL 4.x0) including code examples brought up-to-date with the current standard of the GLSL language.More examples and more exercisesA chapter on tessellation shadersAn expanded Serious Fun chapter with examples that illustrate using shaders to produce fun effectsA discussion of how to handle the major changes occurring in the OpenGL standard, and some C++ classes to help you manage that transition, , The authors thoroughly explain the concepts, use sample code to describe details of the concepts, and then challenge you to extend the examples.

These programmed visions have also made computers, based on metaphor, metaphors for metaphor itself, for a general logic of substitutability., , Chun argues that the clarity offered by software as metaphor should make us pause, because software also engenders a profound sense of ignorance: who knows what lurks behind our smiling interfaces, behind the objects we click and manipulate?

Six essays explore design approaches for developing the aesthetic potential of electronic products outside a commercial context--considering such topics as the post-optimal object and the aesthetics of user-unfriendliness--and five proposals offer commentary in the form of objects, videos, and images. These include ""Electroclimates,"" animations on an LCD screen that register changes in radio frequency; ""When Objects Dream...,"" consumer products that ""dream"" in electromagnetic waves; ""Thief of Affection,"" which steals radio signals from cardiac pacemakers; ""Tuneable Cities,"" which uses the car as it drives through overlapping radio environments as an interface of hertzian and physical space; and the ""Faraday Chair: Negative Radio,"" enclosed in a transparent but radio-opaque shield.Very little has changed in the world of design since Hertzian Tales was first published by the Royal College of Art in 1999, writes Dunne in his preface to this MIT Press edition: ""Design is not engaging with the social, cultural, and ethical implications of the technologies it makes so sexy and consumable."" His project and proposals challenge it to do so.",0,The MIT Press,2014-05-22 17:08:27 +0000,,0,0,2008-09-26 04:00:00 +0000,$19.95,0,,,,,0,,,,"Hertzian Tales: Electronic Products, Aesthetic Experience, and Critical Design",,51E52E0B-209A-42E0-B8A1-098203AEAC00,,0,0.8,6.69,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41vQH7kOjuL.jpg

The Internet and the digital environment present writers with new challenges and opportunities to reconceive creativity, authorship, and their relationship to language. Confronted with an unprecedented amount of texts and language, writers have the opportunity to move beyond the creation of new texts and manage, parse, appropriate, and reconstruct those that already exist., , In addition to explaining his concept of uncreative writing, which is also the name of his popular course at the University of Pennsylvania, Goldsmith reads the work of writers who have taken up this challenge. Examining a wide range of texts and techniques, including the use of Google searches to create poetry, the appropriation of courtroom testimony, and the possibility of robo-poetics, Goldsmith joins this recent work to practices that date back to the early twentieth century. Writers and artists such as Walter Benjamin, Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, and Andy Warhol embodied an ethos in which the construction or conception of a text was just as important as the resultant text itself.

At the same time, it examines the story of our developing concept of the universe we live in: from the ancient visions of a cosmos regulated by the music of the spheres to our current understanding of an expanding universe controlled by the laws of quantum mechanics and string theory. Running through all this is one recurring question - the so-called puzzle of consonance. Why do humans respond to music and musical sounds the way they do? It is the attempts by musicians and scientists through the ages to apply new knowledge to answer this question that gives this story its fascination., , Measured Tones should provide rewarding reading for any physics teacher or student who would like to know more about music and where it impinges on their subject as well as for anyone who is musically inclined.",0,CRC Press,2014-05-22 17:38:21 +0000,,0,0,2002-03-01 05:00:00 +0000,$59.95,0,,,,,0,,,,"Measured Tones: The Interplay of Physics and Music,2nd Edition",,DD6CDDB7-025C-4FF2-B2A7-DCABDAD91878,,0,1.43,6.1,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41dSU0i3drL.jpg

In fact, when it comes to understanding the brain, art got there first., Taking a group of artists  a painter, a poet, a chef, a composer, and a handful of novelists  Lehrer shows how each one discovered an essential truth about the mind that science is only now rediscovering. We learn, for example, how Proust first revealed the fallibility of memory; how George Eliot discovered the brain’s malleability; how the French chef Escoffier discovered umami (the fifth taste); how Cézanne worked out the subtleties of vision; and how Gertrude Stein exposed the deep structure of language  a full half-century before the work of Noam Chomsky and other linguists. It’s the ultimate tale of art trumping science., More broadly, Lehrer shows that there’s a cost to reducing everything to atoms and acronyms and genes. Measurement is not the same as understanding, and art knows this better than science does. An ingenious blend of biography, criticism, and first-rate science writing, Proust Was a Neuroscientist urges science and art to listen more closely to each other, for willing minds can combine the best of both, to brilliant effect.",0,Mariner Books,2014-05-22 17:08:34 +0000,,0,0,2008-09-01 04:00:00 +0000,$14.95,0,,,,,0,,,,Proust Was a Neuroscientist,,C668A8D3-7249-4F15-9E11-B73B9D94B1E7,,0,0.58,5.4,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Ig607AQVL.jpg

Excerpt from the Introduction, , Haskell is fun, and that’s what it’s all about!, , This book is aimed at people who have experience programming in imperative languages—such as C++, Java, and Python—and now want to try out Haskell. But even if you don’t have any significant programming experience, I’ll bet a smart person like you will be able to follow along and learn Haskell., , My first reaction to Haskell was that the language was just too weird. But after getting over that initial hurdle, it was smooth sailing. Even if Haskell seems strange to you at first, don’t give up. Learning Haskell is almost like learning to program for the first time all over again. It’s fun, and it forces you to think differently., , NOTE, If you ever get really stuck, the IRC channel #haskell on the freenode network is a great place to ask questions. The people there tend to be nice, patient, and understanding. They’re a great resource for Haskell newbies., , So, What's Haskell?, , Haskell is a purely functional programming language., , In imperative programming languages, you give the computer a sequence of tasks, which it then executes. While executing them, the computer can change state. For instance, you can set the variable a to 5 and then do some stuff that might change the value of a. There are also flow-control structures for executing instructions several times, such as for and while loops., , Purely functional programming is different. You don’t tell the computer what to do—you tell it what stuff is. For instance, you can tell the computer that the factorial of a number is the product of every integer from 1 to that number or that the sum of a list of numbers is the first number plus the sum of the remaining numbers. You can express both of these operations as functions., , > Read the Introduction (PDF) in its entirety.",0,No Starch Press,2014-05-22 17:39:53 +0000,,0,0,2011-04-21 04:00:00 +0000,$44.95,0,,,,,0,,,,Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!: A Beginner's Guide,,DC8311BC-511B-4CC7-9BC1-127F7EA05AF8,,0,1.75,7,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41gFvETJlGL.jpg

Design By Numbers is a reader-friendly tutorial on both the philosophy and nuts-and-bolts techniques of programming for artists.Practicing what he preaches, Maeda composed Design By Numbers using a computational process he developed specifically for the book.

Representation is being replaced by simulation, and the crafting of objects is moving towards the generation of integrated systems through designer-authored computational processes. While there is a particular history of such an approach in architecture, its relative newness requires the continued progression of novel modes of design thinking for the architect of the 21st century. This AD Reader establishes a foundation for such thinking.  It includes multifaceted reflections and speculations on the profound influence of computational paradigms on architecture. It presents relevant principles from the domains of mathematics and computer science, developmental and evolutionary biology, system science and philosophy, establishing a discourse for computational design thinking in architecture. Rather than a merely technical approach, the book will discuss essential intellectual concepts that are fundamental not only for a discourse on computational design but also for its practice., , This anthology provides a unique collection of seminal texts by authors, who have either provided a significant starting point through which a computational approach to design has been pursued or have played a considerable role in shaping the field. An important aspect of this book is the manner in which adjacent fields and historical texts are connected. Both the source of original inspiration and scientific thought are presented alongside contemporary writings on the continually evolving computational design discourse. Emerging from the field of science, principally the subjects of morphogenesis, evolution and mathematics, selected texts provide a historical basis for a reconfigured mindset of processes that generate, arrange and describe form. Juxtaposed against more contemporary statements regarding the influence of computation on design thinking, the book offers advancements of fundamental texts to the particular purpose of establishing novel thought processes for architecture, theoretically and practically.

With the increasing complexity of computer technology and the resulting specialization of knowledge, such clarity is often lost. Unlike other texts that cover only one aspect of the field, The Elements of Computing Systems gives students an integrated and rigorous picture of applied computer science, as its comes to play in the construction of a simple yet powerful computer system.Indeed, the best way to understand how computers work is to build one from scratch, and this textbook leads students through twelve chapters and projects that gradually build a basic hardware platform and a modern software hierarchy from the ground up. In the process, the students gain hands-on knowledge of hardware architecture, operating systems, programming languages, compilers, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering. Using this constructive approach, the book exposes a significant body of computer science knowledge and demonstrates how theoretical and applied techniques taught in other courses fit into the overall picture.Designed to support one- or two-semester courses, the book is based on an abstraction-implementation paradigm; each chapter presents a key hardware or software abstraction, a proposed implementation that makes it concrete, and an actual project. The emerging computer system can be built by following the chapters, although this is only one option, since the projects are self-contained and can be done or skipped in any order. All the computer science knowledge necessary for completing the projects is embedded in the book, the only pre-requisite being a programming experience.The book's web site provides all tools and materials necessary to build all the hardware and software systems described in the text, including two hundred test programs for the twelve projects.

So, prepare each item individually. For example, for the squash, peel it, then coat it with olive oil, sprinkle it with salt, and roast it in the oven at a temperature around 400–425 F / 200–220 C until it begins to brown. When you go to purée the ingredients, hold back some of the squash and some of the stock, taste the purée, and see which you think it needs. Want it thicker? Add more squash. Thinner? Add more stock.This soup by itself is very basic. Garnish with whatever else you have on hand that you think might go well, such as garlic croutons and bacon. Or top with a small dab of cream, some toasted walnuts, and dried cranberries to give it a feeling of Thanksgiving. How about a teaspoon of maple syrup, a few thin slices of beef, and some fresh oregano? Chives, sour cream, and cheddar cheese? Why not! Instead of purchasing items to follow a recipe exactly, try using leftover ingredients from other meals to complement the squash soup.If you’re in a rush, you can “jump-start” the squash by microwaving it first. Peel and quarter the squash, using a spoon to scoop out the seeds. Then, cube it into 1–2” / 3–5 cm pieces, drop it into a glass baking pan that’s both oven and microwave safe, and nuke it for four to five minutes to partially heat the mass. Remove from microwave, coat the squash with olive oil and a light sprinkling of salt, and roast it in a preheated oven until done, about 20 to 30 minutes. If you’re not in a rush, you can skip the peeling step entirely: cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, add oil and salt, roast it for about an hour (until the flesh is soft), and use a spoon to scoop it out., , Pumpkin Cake, , There are two broad types of cake batters: high- ratio cakes--those that have more sugar and water than flour (or by some definitions, just a lot of sugar)--and low-ratio cakes—which tend to have coarser crumbs. For high-ratio cakes, there should be more sugar than flour (by weight) and more eggs than fats (again, by weight), and the liquid mass (eggs, milk, water) should be heavier than the sugar., , Consider this pumpkin cake, which is a high-ratio cake (245g of pumpkin contains 220g of water--you can look these sorts of things up in the USDA National Nutrient Database, available online at http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/)., , In a mixing bowl, measure out and then mix with an electric mixer to thoroughly combine:, 1 cup (245g) pumpkin (canned, or roast and puree your own), 1 cup (200g) sugar, 3/4 cup (160g) canola oil, 2 large (120g) eggs, 1 1/2 cups (180g) flour, 1/4 cup (40g) raisins, 2 teaspoons (5g) cinnamon, 1 teaspoon (5g) baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon (5g) baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon (3g) salt, 1/2 teaspoon (2g) vanilla extract, , Transfer to a greased cake pan or spring form and bake in an oven preheated to 350 F / 175 C until a toothpick comes out dry, about 20 minutes., , Notes Try adding dried pears soaked in brandy. You can also hold back some of the raisins and sprinkle them on top.One nice thing about high-ratio cakes is that they don’t have much gluten, so they won’t turn out like bread, even with excessive beating. With a total weight of 920 grams, of which only roughly 20 grams is gluten, there just isn’t enough gluten present in this cake to give it a bread-like texture. There’s also a fair amount of both sugar and fats to interfere with gluten development.",0,O'Reilly Media,2014-05-22 17:38:34 +0000,,0,0,2010-08-12 04:00:00 +0000,$34.99,0,,,,,0,,,,"Cooking for Geeks: Real Science, Great Hacks, and Good Food",,F55EE662-3676-4BB9-8F04-8A798DE460B0,,0,2.1,8.029999999999999,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pevMm2GdL.jpg

Recent technological advances allow us to probe and manipulate these pinpoints of sound, dissolving the traditional building blocks of music -- notes and their intervals -- into a more fluid and supple medium. The sensations of point, pulse (series of points), line (tone), and surface (texture) emerge as particle density increases. Sounds coalesce, evaporate, and mutate into other sounds.Composers have used theories of microsound in computer music since the 1950s. Distinguished practitioners include Karlheinz Stockhausen and Iannis Xenakis. Today, with the increased interest in computer and electronic music, many young composers and software synthesis developers are exploring its advantages. Covering all aspects of composition with sound particles, Microsound offers composition theory, historical accounts, technical overviews, acoustical experiments, descriptions of musical works, and aesthetic reflections.

Understanding the historical meaning of the MP3 format entails rethinking the place of digital technologies in the larger universe of twentieth-century communication history, from hearing research conducted by the telephone industry in the 1910s, through the mid-century development of perceptual coding (the technology underlying the MP3), to the format's promiscuous social life since the mid 1990s., , MP3s are products of compression, a process that removes sounds unlikely to be heard from recordings. Although media history is often characterized as a progression toward greater definition, fidelity, and truthfulness, MP3: The Meaning of a Format illuminates the crucial role of compression in the development of modern media and sound culture. Taking the history of compression as his point of departure, Jonathan Sterne investigates the relationships among sound, silence, sense, and noise; the commodity status of recorded sound and the economic role of piracy; and the importance of standards in the governance of our emerging media culture. He demonstrates that formats, standards, and infrastructures—and the need for content to fit inside them—are every bit as central to communication as the boxes we call ""media.""",0,Duke University Press Books,2014-05-22 17:18:14 +0000,,0,0,2012-07-17 04:00:00 +0000,$24.95,0,,,,,0,,"(Sign, Storage, Transmission)",,MP3: The Meaning of a Format,,FCB7D41E-5C72-47C7-8A26-8577053AC791,,0,1.1,6.1,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hDTaSdlQL.jpg
