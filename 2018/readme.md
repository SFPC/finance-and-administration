# SFPC Spring 2018 Report

This document is a high level summary of School for Poetic Computation’s finances and administration between January to June of 2018 and includes suggestions for future budgeting and governance process. It is an open document for SFPC’s steering committee to discuss financial plans and improve administration. After final approval in July, this document will be published on SFPC’s finance GitHub.

*This report is written by Taeyoon Choi in June 2018, and it distinguishes between his personal opinions, and we, plural, for the facts, work and ideas shared by the SFPC team.*

## High level summary of finance

In February 2018, Taeyoon created a budget proposal based on the previous 10 weeks session budget made by Lauren, shared with the SFPC team. Spring session took place between March and May 2018. However it includes finances from January forward.

We had 18 students and offered two work-study scholarships. Total income was $96,060.15 including tuition and bootcamp for Spring 2018 session. The extra includes fees for bank processing.


| **Income**    |               |       |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
|               | Tuition       | $93,500 |
|               | Onboarding    |   $2,500|
|      Sum      |               |  $96,060

| **Expenses**  |               |   |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
|               | Overhead      | $14,053 |
|               | Personnel     | $65,207 |
|       Sum     |               | $85,372 | 

| Profit 	     	| 	 	       	| $11,015|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|


We initially estimated expenses of $83,000 with $13,000 to reserved for SFPC. The total actual expenses was $85,372.31 to date 6/14/2018. The extra expenses are from one time purchases such as chairs and stools, which will be used for future sessions. 

We have a budget sheet is actively utilized to manage the expenses. The amount in this summary may include minor errors due to delays in accounting software and human error. Taeyoon and his assistant will respond to fix any errors.

**Overhead & Services:** Includes rent, utilities and administrative services. It was $14,053.13 for six months. Although the spring session only runs from March to May, it made sense to include January to May for the spring budget because there was no other program active in that period. 

**General Expenses:** Total sum is greater than the estimate because it depends on how we categorize some expenses as an ongoing overhead, one time purchases or as part of the spring session.

Classroom includes materials, tools for class, and Final Event includes services, food, materials for the showcase.

**Food expenses:** We spent more on food than initially budgeted because we had more family dinners. It was a relatively small expansion in the budget, but the return was increased community bonding time. There were some cash expenses for reimbursement of family dinners. Some students wanted to paid in cash if they were international or had no bank in the US.

*Taeyoon’s suggestion: I’d like to have a conversation about developing more detailed categories for general expenses and expenses for future sessions. We also need to consider our monthly rent will rise to $3,000/month and there will be more expenses for space improvement and scaling the team.* 


![Personnel expenses](https://github.com/SFPC/finance-and-administration/blob/master/2018/data/image4.png?raw=true)

Total personnel expenses were $65,207.76. Estimated expenses was $65,815.00. 

Total faculty expenses were $64,480.00. Estimated expenses were $64,315.00. 

Some individual TA and Teacher payment were slightly more or less than initially budgeted, but overall it remains close to the budgeted. In the future, we may consider getting more Bootcamp participants to secure funding to cover the expenses of teachers and TAs, considering the relationship between the profits from short sessions, sponsorships and donation. The last unanticipated expense was the “Other” category, which captured one-time speakers that were generally visiting artists but paid from the Wages category in Xero, or otherwise staff members reimbursed for application review or one-time sessions. 

## Staff agreement and invoice systems ##

Based on Lauren’s suggestion and forms, Taeyoon updated an agreement form. We asked teachers and TAs to sign a standardized agreement form, and send an invoice at the end of each month. This process was helpful to pay staff based on the hours they worked and processing reimbursements. It was helpful in keeping track of the hours worked and pay staff on time. It prevented underpaying or overpaying staff, which happened in the past due to miscommunication between the organizer and financial administrator. Moving forward, we should have agreement and invoice system streamlined and required for all staff including the session organizers and SFPC partners. For Summer and Fall 2018, Taeyoon can continue the oversee the finances, but we will need to hand off the operations to another team member eventually. 


## Teacher fee 

We’ve had $500/session as a standard teaching pay for the last few years. The service includes 3 hours of teaching and 2 hours of office hours. While this is a fair pay compared to other universities in NYC, we may consider raising the pay to $600 - 700/session to reflect their workload and fairness. Teachers for short sessions (1~2 weeks) get paid up to $700 because short sessions are more profitable. We may need to talk about general teachers pay and sliding scale to reflect the overall budget of specific programs. 

How to fairly credit and pay for co-teachers? In the spring, 3 co-teachers had worked on the Craft track. We had individualized pay based on the amount of hours they worked. Kelli was paid more than others, because she worked two extra classes.

*Taeyoon’s opinion: While the Craft class was a huge success in terms of academics, I feel like more than two co-teachers for a class is not desirable from the administration perspective. In the future, it’d be good to have a fixed formula for co teaching, and limit two to co-teachers. Question: Should we pay $300 - 400/session for co-teachers if they are splitting the workload?  What’s a fair pay scale?*   

## TA fee
TA fees were adjusted higher than previous terms. TAs played an important role in the session. TA duties should also include space maintenance and class documentation. It’d be good to plan having more TAs near the showcase. In the future, each TA may have different expectations and roles. The agreement should reflect our expectations of space maintenance, general healthiness of the space. Some TAs may focus on class documentation, installations and tech support. We may consider hiring a session TA, who assists with the general operations, assisting with bookkeeping and documentation. It’s also important to have an all hands (staff + TA + teachers) meeting before the session begins.   
 
## Speaker fee
We’ve been paying visiting artists $100 for a short talk (20 mins) or a casual class visit. We should budget higher fee for visiting speakers in the future. According to [WAGE](https://wageforwork.com/home), we should pay $150 or more. For studio visit, we paid $200 because it’s more time consuming for the speaker. We may consider paying higher for studio visit. 

We have not organized visiting critics or mentors for a few years. I think it’s a good idea to bring in people to give direct feedback to students. For mentoring (not involving presentation), I think $100/session is reasonable. 

Since many speakers don’t use Zelle, it’d be good to reorder checks and minimize the use of PayPal to simplify accounting. 


## Budget, profit and cash flow 
With the profit, we can set up specific goals, such as upgrading space, AC and etc. We can also talk about payment adjustments for some staff who worked over time. It’d be good to have a conversation with our accountant about the yearly cash flow, the relationships between programs, and how to integrate income from other programs to the overhead budget which can be used for bigger purchases and long term work.

*Taeyoon’s opinion. For summer and fall 2018, I’d like to make independent budgets in standardized form that are managed at the same time. In a hypothetical scenario, before the fall program will start in September, invoices for the deposits are being fulfilled as early as May. At the same time, summer workshops are bringing in income and expenses. I’d like to be able to keep multiple, dynamic budgets in sync, in order to make informed decisions about hiring staff, managing savings and investing in infrastructure.*  

 
## Organizer roles 
 Taeyoon worked as a session director, overseeing admin, finance and schedule during the session. He was also available for students on daily basis via online, and IRL twice a week. He was compensated for the hours worked. In the future, it’d be good to have more support from TAs or assistant director for space management. 

In Spring 2018, Taeyoon used his session director salary to hire an assistant to help with budgeting and bookkeeping. In the future, it’d be good to designate the role within the SFPC team or hire a professional bookkeeper in case we scale. Also, it’d be good to get more help from organizers and TAs. 

Currently admin pay covers planning for a session and work during the session for Zach, Lauren and Taeyoon. June and July 2018 would be a good time to review and delineate the three main organizers’ roles and responsibilities. We should also plan to expand the team by giving opportunities to TAs to contribute to administration.  

# Administration and governance

The spring session ran smoothly thanks to the organizers, staff, teachers and TAs. There were much fewer bumps and stress points than previous sessions. However, recurring challenges include scheduling, getting consensus in a timely fashion, and division of responsibility. 

In Spring 2018, Taeyoon oversaw admissions, administration, communications between students and teachers, and taught a class. Zach spoke about the school in public events, curated the SFPC salon, teachers selection, taught a class and helped with the showcase. Lauren oversaw the showcase, student mentorship and community building. Much of our work overlapped and complemented each other. The steering committee joined family dinners, advised students and offered help in public events. 

SFPC is doing very well at the moment; there is a lot of love and support from the community. This would be a great time to push off toward the nonprofit route to secure external funding and build a solid foundation for a long term vision. 

*Taeyoon’s suggestions: In the future, I’d like to have clear delegation, scheduling and decision making procedures for:* 

1. Admin: Announcement, admissions and enrollment
2. Hiring: Teacher selection and contracting  
3. Events: Public events curation and production 
4. Knowledge management: Documentation and archiving
5. Teaching: Mentoring and working with students 
6. Curating: Planning short term sessions and workshops 

*We are splitting the load in three ways, and sometimes it’s not clear. I feel I’m always doing a bit of everything between #1~6 and taking on more than I can handle. Here are my suggestions.* 

#1 Admin can be delegated to another SFPC staff, but not a TA or an outside professional. 

#2 Hiring can be streamlined. At the moment, teacher hiring is done by Zach and Taeyoon in consultation with each other. In the future, it’d be great to have a way for teachers to submit a class idea and have it reviewed by the steering committee and session organizers. 

#3 Events responsibilities are shared by Zach, Lauren and Taeyoon and are fairly well organized. However, we can use more help with production and documentation from TA, alumni, steering or freelancers. 

#4 Knowledge management has been put on the back burner, and a lot of our course materials and student works are lost without a permanent archive. This should be someone’s dedicated job to keep track of ideas and practices at SFPC. This can be a TA position or staff position. 

#5 Teaching is done fairly well by our teachers and organizers. Based on the student feedback from Spring 2018, I think we can improve in pedagogy and facilitation. (Link to student feedback compiled by Lauren) 

#6 Curating is done by three of the staff, but can be done by more staff and the steering committee. 

*Taeyoon summary: I’d like to continue focusing on #1 administration and #4 knowledge management for Summer and Fall of 2018. I think we are in a much better place than a few years ago, and I want to bring our admin up to the point of stability. Then I want to pass on that role to someone else and focus on teaching and curating public events.*
