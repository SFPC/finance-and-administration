# “To Radical Openness and Generosity”

This is a repository of financial data and reflections on administration from the [School for Poetic Computation](http://sfpc.io). We're totally committed to keeping the public informed on how we make and spend money, and empowering our community to actively improve the way we run the school. We especially hope that by sharing our experiences, we can be helpful to those thinking about starting their own schools.

So far we've published: [**/01 — a report on our first semester**](https://github.com/SFPC/finance-and-administration/tree/master/01).

And with each iteration of SFPC, we'll add another folder.

Please direct questions, ideas, and other comments to: [casey@sfpc.io](mailto:casey@sfpc.io)

## About the School for Poetic Computation

SFPC is an artist-run school which launched Fall 2013 in New York. A small group of students and faculty work closely to explore the intersections of code, design, hardware and theory — focusing especially on artistic intervention. It's a 10 week program, a hybrid of residency and research group, that will happen multiple times per year to be a powerboost for creativity. Our motto is: _more poetry, less demo.
