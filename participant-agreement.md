If you have questions about this document, you can reach the school's founders by email at: [info@sfpc.io](mailto:info@sfpc.io).

## 1. Liability Waiver

I understand that by:

- Becoming a student at SFPC
- Participating in classes, events and/or workshops

I agree to take on full responsibility for any risks, damages, injuries, known or unknown, for bodily and/or personal property, which I might incur, including but not limited to:

- Any damage, loss or theft incurred to personal property and/or equipment that I bring into SFPC, or generate/create in any area of SFPC
- Any bodily injuries or damages that I may sustain as a result of participating in any class, workshop, or program on SFPC property
- Any bodily injuries or damages that I may sustain as a result of using any machine or equipment owned by or incurred on SFPC property

I also agree to voluntarily waive any claim that I, my heirs, or legal representatives may have against SFPC, itâ€™s instructors, staff, or owners for any damage, damages, injuries, known or unknown, incurred bodily and/or/on personal property.

## 2. Photo Release

I consent that SFPC has full and unrestricted publishing and use rights for any photographs taken on SFPC property by SFPC employees in which my image or any of my materials or art, either brought in or created at SFPC, appears. I hereby release, discharge, and agree to hold harmless SFPC from any liability by virtue of any blurring, distortion, alteration, optical illusion, or use in composite form whether intentional or otherwise, that may occur or be produced in the taking of said picture or in any subsequent processing thereof, as well as any publication thereof, including without limitation any claims for libel or invasion of privacy.

## 3. Facility Policy and Procedure

The following policies are in place to ensure fair access for all members to our facilities. Failure to abide by these policies may result in termination of membership by staff.

- Space must be kept orderly and neat. Machines must be operated with proper care.
- Please make sure all equipment is returned to the very same state as it was found. If you have any problems or questions, please notify the SFPC staff immediately.
- Failure to follow specific guidelines and procedures may result in the user being held responsible for replacement cost and labor cost of damaged SFPC property.

## 4. Financial Transparency

We plan to continue sharing SFPC's financial statements and narratives publicly on an ongoing basis. Previous administrative records can be accessed at:

http://github.com/sfpc/finance-and-administration

This means: if you pay SFPC or SFPC pays you, you consent to SFPC publishing on a public webpage on the internet: your name (or that of your organization), a dollar amount, and a short description of what was exchanged. We ask for your consent (and explicit communication of problems or questions) in advance of our exchange, so that we don't have to double back before publishing. We (who to take in and spend money on behalf of SFPC) will do our best to make the project of publishing our finances and its implications known to everyone we exchange money with, especially when it may disclose the price of things for which there is not already a public "sticker price" or listed value.

We share our finances out of a spirit of radical openness and generosity. We are trying to push ourselves beyond what is normal, comfortable, and perhaps reasonable when it comes to "openness." It's our hope that members of our organization as well as organizers of future schools will find our financial information useful, but also that it can spark discussions about the industries of art, technology, and education. We hope that our openness can establish trust, or at least help people locate trust.

However, people are more important to us than an experiment about numbers. If for reasons of health, safety, or personal privacy (to name a few) you need to have your information redacted or obfuscated, we can discuss how to do this. (We have not yet had to permanently scrub information.)
