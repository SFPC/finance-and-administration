# 2019 SFPC Final Report
This report is meant to provide a high level, narrative view of School for Poetic Computation’s finances from January 2019 through December 2019.

The purpose is to provide insight and clarity that will help the board or future organizers understand how to schedule programming to be profitable or understand what reserves need to be in place in order to run a program at no profit. This budget narrative will show income and expenses and further delineate expenses between overhead and program related expenses.

*This report was written in July 2019 by Lauren Gardner, a Partner at SFPC.*

## Income and Expenses
SFPC began Jan 2019 with a balance of $113,000. Approximately 40% was profit generated from 2018 but 60% of the balance was tuition deposits made in December 2018 for the 2019 Spring intensive and 2019 January Code Societies programs. So 60% of this balance was already earmarked for upcoming program expenses. In 2019, SFPC made $343,816 in income and had $431,291 in expenses resulting in a deficit of $-84,475.

## Income
Of the total $343,816 in income, almost 80% was generated in tuition sales and 20% in sponsorship of the programming. This is gross income, the amount earned before expenses and taxes.

  - **Sales** are tuition for classes or tickets bought for a workshop or event.
  - **Sponsorship** is when another organization or foundation pays us a flat rate or gives us a grant to run a program.
  - **Event Income** are donations received when we host public, free events. This is not ticket sales.
  - **Rentals** are when we lease our space or items to other schools or orgs.
  - **Other Revenue** examples are income generated through sales of merch, zines or refunds of items we have purchased.

Two programs we ran in 2019 were sponsored. *Poetic Computation: Detroit* was supported by the [Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org/) and *SFPC Summer 2019 in Yamaguchi* was hosted by [YCAM](https://www.ycam.jp/en/). The generous support from these organizations covered the operational costs of running the programs including but not limited to space, salary, lodging, travel, materials, etc.

We were active throughout the year but from May through July, we spent a majority of our time preparing for our two remote programs in Detroit and Japan which resulted in five months of low revenue.

In 2019 we ran more than 7 programs
  - Code Societies; Jan (3 week program)
  - Code Paper Scissors; Feb (2 weeks)
  - Spring 2019; Mar - May (11 weeks)
  - Poetic Computation: Detroit; Aug (1 week)
  - SFPC Summer in Yamaguchi at YCAM; Sep (2 weeks)
  - Fall 2019; Sep - Dec (11 weeks)
In addition, we hosted various workshops & rentals
  - [Math as a Religious experience](https://sfpc.io/religiousmath/), Feb
  - [Code Movement: Workshop by Cori Kresge](https://sfpc.io/classes/movement/), Spring & Fall
  - [BUFU WYFY school](http://distributedweb.care/posts/wyfy/), May
  - [The University of the Underground](http://universityoftheunderground.org/), Aug

## Expenses (overhead / programmatic)
In 2019, over 75% of expenses were in direct support of programs, the remaining 25% supported overhead and operations.
  - **Programmatic Expenses** directly reflect any cost related to supporting classes, workshops or events. *This number is actually 80% when you factor in rent/utilities used during programs.*
  - **Operational Expenses** are expenses that indirectly support programming including rent, equipment, marketing, payroll, outside professional services, insurance, and funds allocated for research and development or professional development.

#### Program Expenses
Of the total $324,563 spent supporting programs, 80% was spent on salaries. These are salaries for people working directly on classes or events including teachers, teaching assistants, visiting artists, organizers and everyone else working directly on the program.

We tried to find ways to better compensate staff for their time or create new paid positions within our programs. This included opening up a new assistant admin position to support the 10-week program to help facilitate institutional knowledge transfer. However, in 2019 we employed 58 people compared to 68 people in 2018. I think this lower number is due to the fact that we were unable to run additional shorter programs between the 10-week sessions. The shorter sessions are a great way for us to work with new teachers and staff.

The second highest expenditure at 7.6% are program expenses. This is anything we need to buy to deliver the program. This includes class materials, items needed for students' final projects displayed at the showcase, anything needed for the space or field trips for the students during the session.

Travel was also higher this year at 5.9% because two of our programs were remote. This includes flights, rental cars, taxis and housing for teachers, teaching assistants and organizers when remote.

We always try to budget generously for food because we have found that providing healthy food and snacks or facilitating ‘family dinners’ with the students reduces the stress levels, promotes conversation and greatly improves the students experience and feeling of well being during the session.

Marketing was a higher amount this year because we wanted to create a comprehensive final report for our session in Detroit. We hired external contractors to help us photograph, film and compile footage from the events and interview the students to gather their feedback and experiences. In addition to the video documentation, we hired contractors to help us compile a zine to summarize learnings from running this remote session.

#### Overhead Expenses
Of the total $106,728 spent on overhead, the largest expense at 50% was in administration wages. We pay $1,500 per month to three administrators to ensure ongoing general operations relating to SFPC. This includes organizing all future programs, documentation, maintaining the space, social media accounts, external communications and being responsive to questions or needs pertaining to the organization.
It is important to note that in addition to the  $1,500 per month stipend, administrators may make additional income during a program for teaching or organizing. For these additional services, administrators will be paid the same daily rate as other contractors. For example, Zach Lieberman taught two 10-week programs in 2019 so his income for the year included both administrative pay (from the general budget) as well as teaching pay (for program budgets).

The second largest expense at 24% was rent at our space in the Westbeth Artists Housing.

At 8% are distribution expenses which are reimbursements to LLC owners for 2018 “phantom income” incurred on behalf of the organization. To be clear, this is not to cover personal tax burden but as SFPC is a passthrough LLC, the owners are responsible for paying the taxes on any profits SFPC has at the end of the year.
For reference:
[“The tax distributions from the LLC are reported on the member’s IRS Form 1040 Schedule C as self-employment income. Even if the LLC does not actually pay a dividend to its member(s) in cash, but retains the funds for cash-flow reasons or reinvestment purposes, the income still appears on the member’s income taxes. This often results in “phantom income,” a tax liability for income not actually received.”](https://www.incnow.com/blog/2019/03/29/capital-contributions-distributions/#:~:text=The%20tax%20distributions%20from%20the,on%20the%20member's%20income%20taxes.)
For example, if a partner was paid 30,000$ but the k1 says 44,000$ (because of SFPC’s profit), there is a 14,000$ additional tax burden for that partner. SFPC covers the taxes only on that difference.  All profits generated by SFPC stay within the school’s bank account and are not disbursed to the LLC holders.

General Expenses include anything needed for the space like furniture or cleaning supplies. New locks and keys were needed this year due to a theft in our space and this ran us over $700. We pay for general insurance for the space to cover our equipment and liability of the students/staff and visitors. Consulting and accounting feels include CPA and bookkeeping costs. Telephone and internet covers wifi in our space. We bought a new mac mini this year to use for streaming and archiving which is the majority of the computer expenses. All ‘other’ expenses include costs for software needed including vimeo, domain hosting, mailchimp newsletter hosting, airtable for forms and contacts and any other items needed for the space that are not specific to a program including paper towels or trash bags.

## Summary and lessons learned
2019 was not a normal year for us. For the past few years we have been diligent about reserving funds for the organization and typically end up with between $30,000 ~$40,000 in savings. In 2017, SFPC had an increase of $47,959 and in 2018, $43,946, which became a reserved balance after tax. Having a reserve allows us to make investments back into the school, space, equipment, community, or programs.

#### Why did we have a deficit?

__*Started to pay admins throughout the year vs. just paying them during programs*__

Before 2019, SFPC’s budgeting practices for administrator’s wages were 100% programmatic. This meant that any money paid to admins or organizers was incorporated into a specific program or event they were working on. The benefit of this practice is that it is easier to budget for a program’s profitability by reducing the overhead costs. The negative was there would be a few months where admins were doing work, but not receiving full pay.

We made a decision with the board to pay a stipend of $1,500 per month for admins to continue working throughout the year. Our hope is that by better recognizing and respecting the ongoing work needed to run the school and administer/organize the programs, we would start to create paying positions within the organization which is something we want to do as we transfer to a new business model. We instituted this change in Spring knowing it would adversely affect the budget but felt this was an important enough change to deal with repercussions if it meant admins could dedicate time to the organization and not have to work extra jobs.

__*Ran two programs designed to break even without plan to augment the loss of revenue*__

We knew which programs are profitable and which only break even. Both are important to our mission but the ones that are not profitable help us build a deeper, more engaged community which is something we strive for. The ten-week sessions and remote programs allow us to build deep relationships with students and work with other artists' spaces and organizations but because of time or travel, there are more expenses involved making it harder for these programs to break even.

Ideally, we would balance the year with a mix of short and long sessions to cover our overhead. Because the opportunity arose to do both the Detroit and Japan program in the same year, we were unable to schedule short programs at the end of the Spring 10-week session as we were using that time period to plan for the remote sessions.

__*Changed programming schedule without revisiting budget*__

This brought up a larger structural concern which was, ‘as an organization, how do we make decisions about what programs to do’. While the sponsored programs aligned with our mission and had a positive impact in outreach, they affected our typical programming schedules and ability to earn income. Both types of programming are important but without a reserve in capital, it is harder to invest in new programs or people.



#### Lessons learned

The deficit from 2019 ate into our savings from 2018 and projected savings from 2019. Starting 2020 with no savings in conjunction with having to shut-down our Spring program due to Covid-19 facilitated the necessity to launch a [GoFundMe fundraiser](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-the-school-for-poetic-comptuation) so we could cover immediate overhead expenses like bills and rent. To be clear, we had enough financial runway to get us into the Spring program but by canceling, we did not have enough savings to afford us the time to develop an alternative source of revenue like the online classes.

The 10-week program’s profit margins are tight and largely dependent on the number of students. Slight fluctuations, like student cancelations (if we lose two accepted students and end up with 15-16 students vs 18-19) have a big impact on the bottom line. We discussed simplifying some aspects of the program to keep costs down without diminishing the community building experience such as replacing a retreat that happens out of the city with a trip to a day spa.

We had only relied on programmatic budgets in the past. Going forward, we will need to create an operational budget that includes individual programs.

We will need to keep the operational budget in mind and monitor our finances more carefully. This might affect how we schedule our programming or necessitate more of a focus on diversifying our revenue streams.

We should confirm each program’s budget in the context of the year’s overall budget before committing to the schedule. For example, if we choose to run a program that will not generate revenue we must ensure we have enough savings to cover operational expenses for a reasonable amount of time.
